Around 2004, Nokia and other companies were working on a technology to bring digital video broadcast to mobile phones. The key standards to enable this were DVB-H, the "handeld" profile of the Digital Video Broadcast standard and DVB-IPDC (IP DataCast), which specified how to send broadcast video and related metadata (the Electronic Service Guide) over an IP connection. 

Inside Nokia the project started as a sort of internal startup, part of the Nokia Ventures Organization incubator, and later graduated to the Nokia Multimedia division. Nokia was developing both network elements (the "Mobile Broadcast Solution") and devices, starting with the experimental Nokia 7700 and 7710.

Standardization played a big role in the project, both in the DVB and Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) bodies, and one of the most contention topics were how to guarantee copy protection and digital rights management. The OMA Mobile TV chapter was divided between Smartphone-based and Smartcard (SIM)-based security, and the fights between mobile phone manufacturers like Nokia and SIM providers like Gemalto were sometimes epic.

Nokia's flagship DVB-H phone was the Nokia N92, codenamed "Magnum", followed by the low-cost N77 and a few more (see here for the full list https://www.phonegg.com/List/DVB-H-Cell-Phones.html)

T-Mobile, Vodafone and O2

The service was launched around 2006 (in time for the soccer world cup) by major operators, and continued to roll out in different countries until it was shut down pretty much everywhere by 2012, replaced by the much more convenient video streaming that didn't require any specialized radio technology. 

## What I did

![Mobile TV network](/work/mobile-tv.jpg)

I was the project manager for the "E-commerce system" (ECS) the server in charge of managing channel subscriptions and distributing digital rights to users' phones. The development of the ECS was fully outsourced to Wipro in Hyderabad, where I traveled several times. In the beginning I was also acting as a "systems architect" and writing specifications and architecture documents, and in this role I attended several standardization meetings in the OMA Mobile Broadcast and DVD groups.

I also supported the sales team in technical pre-sales discussions and answering RFPs and RFQs. One highlight was the work with the "German consortium" that was really a "co-creation" activity involving some very talented technical people.

## What I learned

This was my first project management job and I enjoyed it a lot. I did have a nagging feeling that I was leaving coding behind, but it got drowned by the excitement of finally being able to call the shots and "see the big picture", not to mention having a more varied working day and the traveling. It helped that the team was small and mostly free from interference from the rest of the company, and that I had excellent managers, probably the best I've had in my career.

I had my first exposure to Agile when, out of curiosity, I went to a Certified Scrum Master course (by Jens and Bruce). I never really managed to apply the practices to my work during my time in the Mobile TV team, but I was deeply affected by the Agile Manifesto and the concepts explained in the course. "The true measure of progress is working software" has been one of my mantras ever since.

I definitely stepped out of my comfort zone with the standardization work. Within the year or so that I participated in the OMA activities, I grew from a shy listener with impostor syndrome, to a confident delegate capable of creating and challenging new parts of the standard. The high point was a joint Change Request with Qualcomm, which was tought impossible since Qualcomm was Nokia's arch-enemy in that group (they had a competing technology called MediaFlo).

I often reflect on this time as the point in my career where I left coding behind, which I later regretted. Was it worth it? At the time, definitely. I enjoyed every minute of my time in the Mobile TV team and gained experiences I would never have had as a software engineer, at least not at Nokia. I also discovered that I truly enjoy helping people work well together. Perhaps I should have realized that going back to a technical role after that wouldn't have been such a step back career-wise, but that's what it felt like and that's why I didn't really consider it (although I did interview with Google for a software engineer position, the first of many times that I was rejected by the big G :D).
