The Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) was the third generation cellular communication standard and an evolution of GSM. You probably know it simply as 3G. As a network equipment manufacturer Nokia had been very successful with its GSM platform DX200, and in 2000 it was getting ready for the next generation. One part of this was the Radio Network Controller, based on the ATM protocol, for which Nokia was developing the IPA 2800 platform.

UMTS had a rocky start, what with the ridiculous price of 3G license and the 2000 dotcom bust, but eventually made it to the mainstream and so did IPA 2800. It's probably still installed somewhere.

## What I did

This was my first "real job" as a software engineer, or as it was called, "R&D Engineer". The organization I was part of was called "packet switching department" and was in charge of developing the network infrastructure equipment for the next generation of mobile communication network, which at the time was UMTS or, as it became commonly know, 3G. 

When I joined I worked for a while on the previous generation, DX200/GSM that was programmed using a high-level language called TNSDL (Tele Nokia - SDL). Later I moved to the next generation IPA 2800 that was to be based on a new Posix RTOS called Chorus, programmed using C. One of the most exciting thing I did was to develop the first device driver ever to run on Chorus OS as a proof-of-concept. My responsibility was the device driver for the APC by Agere technologies, later bought by Lucent.

I left the project after two years because at the time my heart was in object oriented programming and I considered what I was doing too "old fashioned". I don't know how much of my code was preserved after I left, but I like to think that for a while my software was somehow involved in getting 3G calls through :)

## What I learned

In retrospect, this wasn't the best starting job for an aspiring software wizard. But the truth is that at the time I was more interested in computer networks than anything else, and I felt that the packet switching department was the right place to continue what I specialized on with my thesis on "Connection Admission Control using Neural Networks" (isn't that a mouthful) and internship at Telecom Italia. At that point I had decided that mobile telecommunications were the future, my future, and Nokia was the biggest name, so I didn't care what I did as long as I could get in.

Technically the job wasn't very interesting, like any other driver mine had to initialize the DSP, read and write some registers and occasionally handle some interrupts. I did however learn a lot about team work, communication and what it's like to work in a huge project. I became an official Nokia Trainer and gave courses about TNSDL, which gave me the chance to visit Hangzhou. At some point I was considered an "expert" because I knew "my" processor inside out, and one of the highlights was when the chief architect came to my room (yes, I had a room) to copy a wall-sized diagram of the registers I had drawn to wrap my head around it.

I discovered my passion for debugging! Remember in the lab, with Tomi Wilska

Making phonecalls to the APSMAN lady to get a release integrated.

And the most important experience of course was that I had to learn to live on my own in another country.
