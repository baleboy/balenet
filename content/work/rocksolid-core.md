From 2020 to 2022 I was the "Head of Products" at [Basemark](https://www.basemark.com), a Finnish start-up with a background in graphics benchmarks that had pivoted to automotive software development before I joined. Soon after I started, we launched a new, ambitious project to create a full software platform for "Software Defined Vehicles" (SDV). The narrative was that automotive platforms were moving from a network of hundreds of different electronic components to a few centralized ones with most of the functionality implemented in software, and needed help from partneres experienced with such a setup.

We scrambled to make a demo for CES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h57mM3UYIiw

I even got into a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhv4RD-NU2o

And I got to share the stage (vitually) with Damon Hill!

And here is the video that sums it all up: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/basemarkltd_basemarklane-keep-assist-drive-activity-7010902412383121408-s5eM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

And I got to work with Oona!
