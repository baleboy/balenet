## About

I am an Italian software engineer living in Finland.

Sometimes I learn about stuff and I feel the urge to write it down. This helps me structure my thoughts and remember what I have learned. To give myself the motivation to finish writing what I started, I created this website.

### Credits

This site was generated using [balenet-gen](https://github.com/baleboy/balenet-gen), my own static site generator written in Swift. It uses the [Ink](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink) markdown parser by John Sundell.

The theme of this site is loosely inspired by the [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum), my first computer.
