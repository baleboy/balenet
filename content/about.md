I am an Italian software professional living in Finland. Yes, you read it right, I left the land of "La Dolce Vita" for the cold and darkness of the far north.

Sometimes I think about stuff and I feel the urge to write it down. This helps me structure my thoughts and remember what I have done. To give myself the motivation to finish what I start writing, I created this website.

The theme of this site is loosely inspired by the ZX Spectrum, my first computer and true love.
