## About

This blog is a random dump of things I learn or find interesting, mainly around programming, videogames, cooking (especially pizza) and family related stuff. I write for myself, but if you find anything interesting or helpful I'd love to know!

The theme of this site is loosely inspired by the [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum), my first computer.
